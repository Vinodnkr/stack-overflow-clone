### Guidelines to develop a project

#### Must Have
- use GitHub
    - Commit code regularly and commit message should be clear

- Write quality code as you would write in a production environment

- You are free to use any component library and CSS framework if you want. We use
multiple things on multiple projects - tailwind, bootstrap, and vanilla CSS. If not
sure lean on plain old CSS and basics and you should be fine. We prefer if you
donâ€™t use any CSS framework.

- Do your best to name and arrange files/components/variables as you would in a
production-ready application.
